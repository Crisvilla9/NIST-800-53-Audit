Work in progress in creating a template for all the control families that summarize 
and help me understand what the control test and discussion of each control is. 
This is will help me understand each and every control identifier in my NIST 800-53 and feel confident and well prepared in front of the individuals I will be auditing. 
So far I have completed the MP category. Will be adding more as I tackle different sections.
